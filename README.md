## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the repo
git clone https://github.com/rahulhaque/soketi-app-manager-filament.git

# Go to the directory
cd soketi-app-manager-filament

cp .env.example .env

php artisan serve

# Install Soketi websocket server
npm install -g @soketi/soketi

## Docker Installation

Some considerations -

- By default port `80` is exposed through nginx. Change the `APP_PORT` in `.env` after copying, before running `docker compose up -d`.
- By default nginx is configured to handle websocket requests as well. No need to expose Soketi port `6001` for websockets. Use the `APP_PORT` instead.
